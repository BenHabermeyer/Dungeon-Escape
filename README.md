# Dungeon-Escape
CIS120 Final Project

This is my final project for CIS120, programming languages and techniques 1. I built a rogue-like dungeon escape game using JAVA swing. .JAVA files, PNG image files, Testing files, and an associated project README are included.

## Running the program
Compile the game
`javac Game.java`

Then run :)
`java Game.java`
